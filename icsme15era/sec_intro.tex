When starting a maintenance task, software developers commonly need to
locate the relevant features in a potentially large and unfamiliar
code base. Due to the difficulty and importance of this task,
researchers have proposed a number of approaches to improve
developers' effectiveness in locating features, largely based upon
applying natural language analysis or text retrieval techniques to source
code~\cite{dit_feature_2013}. Most of the proposed feature location
techniques have treated source code as an unordered set of natural
language terms (i.e., as a bag-of-words), even though recent fundamental
results have shown that source code contains context and flow that is
even more pronounced than natural language
text~\cite{hindle_naturalness_2012}.

%  What are the contributions of this paper and this line of work
%
In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning, a particular class of neural networks that has shown promising
results in modeling natural language, for feature location. In
particular, we investigate the efficacy of document
vectors~\cite{le_distributed_2014}. Document vectors capture the
influence of the surrounding context on each term, which can improve the ranking
of results retrieved for a developer query. For example, in the
statement {\sf diagram.redraw()} the word {\em diagram} is relevant to the word
{\em redraw} and this relationship is captured by document vectors. Therefore, when querying for {\em diagram}, program elements
where {\em redraw} is also present are considered more relevant and thus are boosted in the rankings.

Deep learning natural language approaches also create a novel notion
of semantic similarity between the source code terms. Semantic
similarity is the result of mapping the corpus terms into a continuous
semantic space, where synonyms, antonyms, and other semantic relations
are encoded and easily composed together.

Our preliminary results show that deep learning models of source code provide
improved retrieval results on the Dit et al.~\cite{Dit-etal_2013} dataset.
This dataset contains gold sets extracted the maintenance histories of four open
source projects. We also show that these complex models can be built with
reasonable computational overhead by leveraging recently proposed optimization
approaches. This work establishes several avenues for future exploration and use
of these models to improve developer effectiveness in feature location.
