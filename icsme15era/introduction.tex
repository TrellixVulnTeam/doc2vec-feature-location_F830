When starting a maintenance task, developers commonly need to locate
the relevant features for the task in a potentially large and
unfamiliar code base. Due to the potential for wasted effort,
researchers have proposed a number of approaches to improve
developer's effectiveness in locating features, based largely upon
applying natural language analysis techniques to source code. Most of
the proposed Feature Location Techniques (FLTs) have treated source
code as an unordered set of natural language terms, i.e. as a
bag-of-words, even though recent fundamental results have shown that
source code contains context and flow that is even more pronounced
than natural language text~\cite{naturalness}.

%
In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning models of natural
language for source code that 1) capture a wide amount of context for
each term; 2) can be built with reasonable computational overhead and
3) build a previously not existing notion of semantic similarity
between the source code terms.
