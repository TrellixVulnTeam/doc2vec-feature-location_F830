When starting a maintenance task, software developers commonly need to
locate the relevant features for the task in a potentially large and
unfamiliar code base. Due to the potential for wasted effort,
researchers have proposed a number of approaches to improve
developers' effectiveness in locating features, based largely upon
applying natural language analysis techniques to source
code~\cite{dit's survey}. Most of the proposed Feature Location
Techniques (FLTs) have treated source code as an unordered set of
natural language terms, i.e. as a bag-of-words, even though recent
fundamental results have shown that source code contains context and
flow that is even more pronounced than natural language
text~\cite{naturalness}.

%
In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning, which has shown
promising results in modeling natural language, to the task of feature
location. The main advantage of deep learning is the ability to
capture the influence of context on each term, which greatly improves
many tasks...Our preliminary results show that deep learning models of
source code, can be built with reasonable computational overhead while
creating a previously not existing notion of semantic similarity
between the source code terms. This work also establishes several
avenues for future exploration and use of these models to improve
feature location.
