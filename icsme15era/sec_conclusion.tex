%future work: 
%try in the field (e.g. in Sando)
%maybe try at larger scale 
%incorporate program structure information
%paragraph for each new problem in feature location that this could help (e.g. recommendation)
%Context (compare to n-gram, V-DO stuff)

% conclusing remarks:
%   doc2vec faster, could be easier to implement directly into an IDE search
%   tool
%   doc2vec inference needs more exploration for parameter tweaking
%   doc2vec vector summation, although slower, is at an acceptable time


In this work we present a preliminary study on applying a deep-learning-based
FLT using document vectors (\dv). We find that training the document vector
model has low computational overhead (i.e., is quick), while maintaining
accuracy on par with LDA. We find \dv\ to be a promising solution to implementing
smarter developer search tools, something heavier-weight model such as LDA have
yet to accomplish.

Future work includes investigating the approaches performance at differing granularities.
Additionally, work is needed to investigate effective parameter configurations for the model.
