%   i.) Describe all the steps of the system
%       *is it Sando-like except for the model? (i.e. parsing->stopwords->splitting->indexing+program_element_based_weighting)
%


%  ii.) Describe optimal values for parameters (like window size and feature vector length)
%	*use paper by Poshyvanyk for hints on this
%


%  iii.) What are the expected advantages over its counterparts (n-grams, V-DO, MRF)?
%       *speed and retrieval effectiveness, i suppose
%


%  iv.) Other advantages of deep learning?
%       *e.g. query recommendation based on semantic similarity from deep learning
