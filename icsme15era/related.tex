%  Describe deep learning for natural language
%
Statistical natural language models, such as the n-gram model, have
seen widespread use for a variety of natural language processing tasks
due to their simplicity and effectiveness when trained with a
substantial corpus of text. Software engineering researchers have
shown n-gram models to be even more effective for source code than for
natural language documents~\cite{hindle_naturalness_2012}. More recent
research in has proposed deep learning methods, consisting of specific
classes and architectures of neural networks, that can produce capable
statistical models of natural language text, able to capture more
complex patterns while being trained using smaller corpora relative to
the n-gram model~\cite{mikolov_distributed_2013}. Using a set of
optimizations strategies such models can be built at reasonable
computational costs for even large textual
corpora~\cite{le_distributed_2014}. In this paper we examine the
effectiveness and potential applicability of these deep learning
models for the problem of feature location in software engineering.

%    in S.E. White's paper

White et al. reported very promising results in applying deep learning
models for source code, outperforming models based on similar n-gram
configurations in code completion tasks~\cite{white-paper}. Their work
establishes the use of deep learning for software engineering
problems, sketching out several avenues for future use of such models,
including code completion and the building of synonym
dictionaries. Our work extends their contribution to the feature
location problem. A notable difference to the prior experiments of
deep learning for source code performed by White et al. is that the
deep models in this paper are based solely on the identifiers and
comments in the source code of a single software project, while White
et al. considered the entire source listing of several combined
projects.




%  iii.) Context based approaches to feature location
%	*Emily Hill et al. “One the use of Positional Proximity for IR-Based Feature Location”

%       *Naturalness

Previous feature location techniques that incorporated surrounding
context in the model has shown high degrees of effectiveness. Examples
include the use of verb and direct object pairs by Shepherd et
al.~\cite{dave}, statement level markov random fields
hill~\cite{hill_use_2014}. Howard at al.~\cite{howard} utilized rules
based on natural language text in leading method comments to mine
synonym dictionaries from source code repositories. One of the
additional capability of deep models is to mine such terms at a
greater scale relative to the their approach.
